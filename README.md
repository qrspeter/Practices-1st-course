# Practices 

## interest_rate.py
Calculate the deposit amount taking into account the interest rate in a few years. Apply f-strings to show the result.

## wien_law.py 
Using the Wien's law  calculate wavelength of a peak position of radiation at different temperature of a body. Check input values.

## plank_law.py
Plot spectra of radiation of different objects using Planck's law of blackbody radiation

## polyfit_approximation.py
Make a random data and apply polynomial approximation with different degree.

## read_all_files.py
A way to read all files from the folder

## timer_dispersion/
Calculate average and dispersion for data from a timer in file.

## read_list/
Make a "horizontal" 2D array with 2 rows (then "vertical" witn 2 columns), write it to a file, read and print.

## hash/
Make a function to calculate hash of a string using bitwise  XOR, then using Pearson hashing (using a key table), then make a hash for every string in a file.

## raman_norm/
Plot Raman specra of reduced graphene oxide and another samples. Normalize data.

## photoconductivity_gas_sensor/
Load test data (signal I(t) from gas sensor, obtained in the same conditions) from 5 files, average them and plot averaged data.

## carbon_dots_spectra/
Load fluorescence spectra of carbon dots in different solvents (Acetone, Chloroform, Ethanol, Toluene, water). Find a wavelength of maximum absorption (the wavelength more than 300 nm) for each sample. Plot wavelength of the maximum absorption as a function of solvent polarity. Approximate the function.

## decay_times/
Fit the fluorescence decay of PbS quantum dots with exponential function using numpy only. Find the decay constant.

## CIE1931_color/
Find color coordinates for spectra of Carbon dots LED and place then on the chromaticity diagram CIE1931

## perceptron/
Single Layer Perceptron and recognition of 1D arrays

## recognition_PbS/
Recognition of two types of spectra

## repeated_execution/
Repeated execution and reading data from a power meter PM100D

## smoothing.py
Generate randon 1D data and smooth them by averaging
